His keen understanding of the retail industry and fashion catapulted the brand to instant fame and recognition pan India. Apart from acquiring a substantial minority stake in the designer label Anju Modi, he also launched the fashion label “Rangriti” to enhance the Company's presence at lower price points and cater to a large segment.</p>
